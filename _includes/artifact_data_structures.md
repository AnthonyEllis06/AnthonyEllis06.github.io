## Data Structures and Algorithms Enhancement
My original Data Structures and Algorithms artifact comes from my Data structures and Algorithms class where we built and defined various data structures from scratch in C#. I am reusing the same artifact that I showcased an enhancement for in my Software Design and Engineering however I want to showcase a different set of enhancements that focus on data structure specifically. The original artifact was a list data structure that used the base list class to create a custom list that implemented different sorting algorithms to sort and edit the names list. For this enhancement I did a complete overhaul of the original design by creating a new data structure, a doubly linked list, one for the client objects and one for the appointment objects. I wrote my own custom base node class and then implemented the doubly linked list structure into a custom linked list for both the client and appointment objects. I built this data structure from the ground up in order to create a more lightweight, client side solution. I built this data structure in the Django static JavaScript files to help keep the front end reactive and not needing to constantly pull all the appointments. this is useful for small client base however for a larger client base I would need to remove this implementation as this is also primarily to showcase my data structures and algorithms knowledge.
