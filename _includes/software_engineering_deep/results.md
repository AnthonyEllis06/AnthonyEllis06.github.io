I really want to take some time to showcase how much better and useful this application is compared to the original artifact. The original artifact was very simple and only showcased a basic understanding data structures and algorithms but that was its only purpose. The enhanced version takes that same concept of a list of names and applies it to a real world use case through the small addition of appointments and a web based user interface. The ability to access the application through the web really give this project depth to be more than just a simple list manager and makes it a useful too that could eventually lead to better time management for a small business. I also managed to keep the whole project fairly vague and it could be easily repurposed and changed for any style of business that needs an appointment management system.
