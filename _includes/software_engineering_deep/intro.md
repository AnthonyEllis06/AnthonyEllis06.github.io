There are three main enhancements that I would like to highlight between the original artifact and the enhanced version that I believe best showcase my software engineering skills. The first enhancement is the conversion from a simple C# application that was not web based and required the user to have visual studio installed to be able to run the application to complete Django web application inside of a docker container, easily accessible through a web browser. The choice to create the application as a web application was largely influenced by the neccesity for easy access by the owner. I also built the whole application with the idea of containerization in mind to allow for easy deployment and sharing of the project. The second enhancement that I would like to highlight is the change in the user experience, due to this being run in a container and being web based it can be run on a single machine and setup to be accessed by multiple devices on the same local network. The third enhancement I would like to highlight is the use of Django's built in admin page that is generated by the django framework using the models created for the database, this in conjuctions with dockers ability to run both the frontend and backend in teh same container made it very easy to setup the postgresql database after my initial development was completed.
